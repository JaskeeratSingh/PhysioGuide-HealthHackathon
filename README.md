# PhysioGuide-HealthHackathon
Using an implementation of PoseNet in Tensorflow.js enabling anyone with access to the internet to treat themselves.
My project allows a patient to treat themselves or any other person to assist the patient as a physiotherapist while also recieving feedback on how well they were doing.

# Problem Statement
The average cost for a course of physiotherapy treatment is around £225 – £420(17,500₹ to 32,500₹)

A large number of people cannot afford such treatment which may lead to worsening of the situation and even permanent damage. 
Since after a lot of diseases patients are put on bedrest and face problems walking again and getting the leg muscles back in order,
physiotherapy courses are essential. 
It is utmost that the unnecessary price be removed.

# Solution - PhysioGuide

PhysioGuide provides an ideal exercise for the treatment of pain in any region of the body and compares how the user performs the 
same posture or exercise and gets a score that indicates how well he/she's doing.
